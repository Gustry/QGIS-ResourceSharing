### QGIS Resource Sharing Plugin
If you have ever wanted to share QGIS resources easily with your peers, 
this plugin comes to the rescue!

The QGIS Resource Sharing plugin allows QGIS users to share resources
(symbols, SVGs, images, processing models, processing scripts and R
scripts) in repositories that other users can access.
A repository could be a remote GIT repository (for now Github and
Bitbucket public repositories are supported), local file system
collections, or zipped collections on the Web.

The plugin was initially implemented as a Google Summer of Code project
in 2016 for QGIS under the OSGeo organization by Akbar Gumbira (student),
Alessandro Pasotti (mentor), Anita Graser (mentor), and with the help of
Richard Duivenvoorde, Tim Sutton, and the QGIS community.
