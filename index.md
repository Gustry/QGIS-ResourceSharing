### QGIS Resource Sharing Tools
This tools allows QGIS users to share resources (symbols, svgs, 
images, or processing scripts) in a repository so that other users can use it
. Repository could be defined in remote GIT repositories (for now it supports 
Github and Bitbucket public repositories), or local file system. 

This tool is initially implemented as Google Summer of Code 2016 project for 
QGIS under OsGeo organization by Akbar Gumbira (student), Alessandro Pasotti 
(mentor), Anita Graser (mentor), and the help from QGIS community.
