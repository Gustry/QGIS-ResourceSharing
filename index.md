Have you ever wished you can share QGIS resources easily with your peers? 
Well, this tool might be handy for you!

This tools allows QGIS users to share resources (symbols, svgs, images, or 
processing scripts) in a repository so that other users can use it. 
Repository could be defined in remote GIT repositories (for now it supports 
Github and Bitbucket public repositories), local file system, or in http(s) 
with zip collections.

QGIS under OSGeo organization by Akbar Gumbira (student), Alessandro Pasotti 
(mentor), Anita Graser (mentor), and the help of Richard Duivenvoorde, 
Tim Sutton, and QGIS community.
