In order for the plugin to be able to read the repository correctly, the 
repository must have a specific structure. Generally the structure looks like
this (models and R scripts are missing, but are at the same level as *image*,
*processing*, *svg* and *symbol*):

![Repo structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/repo_structure.png)


To see an example of a repository, check this github repository [Test Repository](https://github.com/akbargumbira/qgis_resources_data/)
