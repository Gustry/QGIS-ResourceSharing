In order for the plugin to be able to read the repository correctly, the 
repository must have a specific structure.
The general structure is shown in the illustration below.
Note that in the diagram, the ``models`` and ``rscripts`` folders are missing.
They are at the same level as ``image``, ``processing``, ``svg`` and ``symbol``.
