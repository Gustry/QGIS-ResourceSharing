Everything is done, you have your repository published somewhere, and you can 
add the repository from your QGIS. You're wondering if you can put your 
repository as a default repository that will be shown to every other QGIS 
users without them needing to add manually the repository. Well, yes you can 
do that.
 
To make your repository listed as default repository, please fork this 
Github project [QGIS official resource repository](https://github
.com/qgis/QGIS-Resources), update the ```directory.csv``` file and make a 
pull request to the upstream project. If you are not comfortable doing this 
or you don't have Github account, please email me (akbargumbira(at)gmail.com) 
and tell me the detail of your repository.
