### Preparing the Repository
In order for the tools to parse the repository correctly, you need to prepare
 the repository to have a certain structure. This is what you need to do:
 * The repository has to follow this structure. Please go to [this page]({{ 
 site.baseurl }}/author/repository-structure.html) that explains the structure
  of the repository
 * Create the correct metadata for the repository. For that, please read [this
  page]({{ site.baseurl }}/author/creating-metadata.html)
 * Once you have it prepared, you can check if the repository is all good by 
 trying to use it using file system handler. In the plugin, go to 
 ```Settings``` tab and add a new repository pointing to the root of the 
 repository in your local file system. The repository URL might look like 
 this: ```file:///home/pointing/to/repository_root``` or in Windows it looks 
 more like this: ``````file://C:/home/pointing/to/repository_root``````
