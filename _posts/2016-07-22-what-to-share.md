In the repository, you can share collections. Collection is defined as a set 
of resources that belongs together i.e can be used to create a coherent map 
design or to do a specific task.
 
The items that you can share on the repository are:

Item | Notes
--- | ---
Images | SVG files or other image files that can be used for svg marker or raster fill
Symbols | In the form of XML that could contain marker, line, fill, or colorramp
Styles | In the form of QML file
Processing scripts | Python processing scripts

Note that you can actually put other QGIS resources in the repository 
(composer templates or project files), but for now they will be ignored in a 
way that the plugin will not do anything to them (e.g installing the resources).
